This file details specifics for NetHack built for the Universal Windows
Platform (UWP).  We will to this port as the NetHack UWP port.

New players should be sure to read GuideBook.txt which contains 
essential information about playing NetHack.  It can be saved to a
folder from the main menu.

The UWP port supports some additional or enhanced commands as well as some 
defaults.nh file options specific to configuration choices used during the
building of NetHack. Listed below are those commands and defaults.nh file 
options. 

Some sections of this file have not yet been updated for the UWP port as noted
below.

Contents
1. Main Menu
2. ALT Key Combinations
3. Boolean options - Option that you can toggle on or off
4. Numeric Keypad (for number_pad mode)
5. Color palette


1. Main Menu
----------------------------------------------
When the application is launched, you are placed at a main menu which allows
the player to perform some additional actions before entering the standard
NetHack game.

Theses are the currently suported actions:

    Play - enters the NetHack game.
	
	Change NETHACKOPTIONS - the NetHack UWP port can not support Windows
	environment variables due to lack of operating system support.  This action
	allows the player to modify NETHACKOPTIONS as needed.

    Save defaults.nh to file - this will save the game's internal version of
	defaults.nh to a file the user picks.
	
	Load defaults.nh from file - loads a file the user picks replacing the 
	game's internal version of defaults.nh.
	
	Reset defaults.nh - resets the game's internal version of defaults.nh to
	its original version which was installed with the game.

	Save Guidebook.txt - stores the text file Guidebook.txt to a location the
	user picks.  It is highly recommended that any new player reads this file.

sequence.

3. Boolean Options (Options that can be toggled on or off)
----------------------------------------------------------

Listed here are any options not discussed in the main help, options 
which may be slightly different from the main help file, and options 
which may need a slightly more explanatory note: 

    color          Use color when displaying map. Default: [TRUE]

    hilite_pet     Your pet is hilited. Default: [TRUE]

    symset         Symbols to use to represent map.

    toptenwin      Write top ten list to a window, as opposed to stdout.
                   Default in tty interface: [TRUE]
				   

4. Numeric Keypad (for "OPTION=number_pad" mode)
------------------------------------------------


The numeric keypad and surrounding characters act as macros for different
commands in NetHack.  The Num Lock should be toggled to "on" to make the
most of these keys:

          Key         Normal       Shift-Key
       ----------   ----------    -------------
       1, 2, 3, 4   Move In       Run In
       6, 7, 8, 9   Direction     Direction

        0 (Ins)     Inventory     Categorized
                                  Inventory

        . (Del)     Wait Turn     : - Look Here

        +           Spell List    P - Put on an
                                  accessory

        -           m - Move      Previous
                    Only          Message


      When you use the Ctrl key with a directional key (1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 9)
	  it means "go in specified direction until you hit a wall or run into
	  something interesting."
	  
5. Color Palette
------------------------------------------------
The color palette can be set in either the defaults.nh file or by setting
NETHACKOPTIONS.  The format of the options is:
  palette:<color-name>-red-green-blue
