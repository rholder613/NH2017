Notes

- We can't get user name without adding the capability to application.  It seems intrusive to require
  the user to give the application access to his/her user name.  We will allow the user to enter his/her
  name at launch and we will not leverage the network user name capabilities of Nethack.

- We do not currently support user sounds.

- SYSCF is not supported (no need to have additional administrator configuration settings)

- mouse is supported including right click support

- Environment variables can not be used in 64bit store apps.  We will
  need to allow user to specify persistent options some other way.

- keypad is supported.

- had to disable optimizations due to compiler bug.  causing a crash in the options code.

- had to check that num lock was not active when enquing a key down event for keypad.  If num pad is active
  then a character will be generated alonw with the key down event causing two events to be queued for every
  key stroke.

- marked the application as high dpi aware

- found a problem with key bindings due to the static local backed_dir_cmd in reset_commands() when playing
  game for second time the flag is not in the right state since it retains the setting from the previous
  game.  The simple fix to this problem is to set the flag again when initial is true.  The problem is that
  this type of problem can be throughtout the code.  Probably can only find these types of problems by
  code inspection.
