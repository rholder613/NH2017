High Priority

Medium Priority
- Review all options
- Protoype just calling into DWrite to render grid instead of trying to use D3D11 (although we
  we still need a means to render tiles eventually)
- Review all code looking for more static locals.  This can be a problem since we can't re-initialize.
- number_pad option value is not preserved across saves -- is this documented?  Is this how it is
  supposed to be?  What options are saved with game?
- Review all options and note which are supported and not supported.
- Need to create seperate projects for makedefs for compiling the different options.
- Polish windows store description.
- Polish GIT hub wiki pages.
- Clean up UWP file naming and placement.
- Place TextGrid positioned at top of window.

Low Priority
- Add ability to load/store/restore symbols
- see if we can remove WIN32CON definition (currently defined in vcxproj )
- persist options which are set (low priority since NETHACKOPTIONS environment variable can be used)
- add arm and arm64 support
- Add more advanced gesturing support.
- Consider supporting tiles.
- Consider providing a more advanced windowing support
- Distinguish between development builds and official application package builds and set the build
  version of development builds to zero

Official NetHack Pull Request Work
- Update various distribution documentation to describe UWP port.
- Conform to coding standards.
- Determine if copyright notices are correct.
